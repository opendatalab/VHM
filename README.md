## Install
Refer to the following command for installation.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:opendatalab/VHM.git
cd VHM
conda create -n vhm 
conda activate vhm
pip install -r requirment.txt
```
## Data
You should follow this instruction [Data.md](docs/Data.md) to manage the datasets. If you need to train our model from scratch, please refer to for data download and preparation first.
## Models
VHM consists of a visual encoder, a projector layer, and a large language model (LLM). The visual encoder uses a pretrained [CLIP-14-336px](https://huggingface.co/openai/clip-vit-large-patch14-336), the projector layer is composed of two MLP layers, and the LLM is based on the pretrained [Vicuna-7B](https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.5). The model is trained in two stages, as shown in the diagram below.

![](docs/images/vhm_train_stage.png)


We provide not only the weights after the SFT stage but also the Pretrained weights.

| Name | Description|
|---|---|
|[VHM_sft](https://huggingface.co/FitzPC/vhm_7B) | The LLM and MLP weights obtained from the SFT stage| 
|[VHM_pretrain](https://huggingface.co/FitzPC/vhm_7b_pretrain_mlp_llm/tree/main) | The LLM and MLP weights obtained from the Pretraining stage.|
|[CLIP_pretrain](https://huggingface.co/FitzPC/vhm_7b_pretrain_vit)|The CLIP weights obtained from the  Pretraining stage.|


## Train
VHM model training consists of two stages: (1) Pretrain stage: use our VersaD dataset with 1.4M image-text pairs to finetune the vision encoder, projector, and the LLM to align the textual and visual modalities; (2) Supervised Fine-Tuningï¼ˆSFTï¼‰ stage: finetune the projector and LLM to teach the model to follow multimodal instructions. 
### Pretrain
First, you should download the [MLP projector](https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/llava-v1.5-mlp2x-336px-pretrain-vicuna-7b-v1.5/tree/main) pretrained by LLaVA-1.5. Because a rough modality alignment process is beneficial before using high quality detailed captions for modality alignment.

You can run `sh scripts/rs/slurm_pretrain.sh` to pretrain the model. Remember to specify the projector path in the script. In this stage, we fine-tuned the second half of the vision encoder's blocks, projector, and LLM.

In our setup we used 16 A100 (80G) GPUs and the whole pre-training process lasted about 10 hours. You can adjust the number of gradient accumulation steps to reduce the number of GPUs.

In the `sh scripts/rs/slurm_pretrain.sh`, you need to revise three paths:
```bash
DATA_DIR=pretrain_base # directory of VersaD dataset
export LIST_FILE=${DATA_DIR}/list_pretrain.json # json file of VersaD data  
export CKPT_PATH=weight_path # llava-1.5 MLP weight path
export SAVE_PATH=vhm-7b_prtrained # file save path
```
### Supervised Fine-Tuning
In this stage, we finetune the projector and LLM with our [VHM_SFT](https://huggingface.co/datasets/FitzPC/VHM_dataset_sft) dataset. 

In our setup we used 8 A100 (80G) GPUs and the whole sft process lasted about 4 hours. You can adjust the number of gradient accumulation steps to reduce the number of GPUs.

You can run `sh scripts/rs/slurm_finetune.sh` to finetune the model, and you need to revise three paths:
```bash
DATA_DIR=sft_base # directory of vhm-sft dataset
export LIST_FILE=${DATA_DIR}/list_sft.json # json file of sft data  
CKPT=vhm-7b_pretrained # pretrain weight path
export SAVE_PATH=vhm-7b_sft # file save path
```

## Evaluation 
In order to facilitate the use of remote sensing vision-language large models, we have developed a specialized evaluation project [RSEvalKit](https://github.com/fitzpchao/RSEvalKit) for remote sensing large models. Please refer to the following command for installation.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/fitzpchao/RSEvalKit
cd RSEvalKit
conda create -n rseval
conda activate rseval
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
All evaluation tasks for this paper are implemented in RSEval  and can be evaluated with one click. First, you need to download our [model weights](#models) and [VHM_Eval data](docs/Data.md#VHM_Eval-Dataset ), then follow the [instructions](https://github.com/fitzpchao/RSEvalKit/blob/master/README.md) to complete the evaluation.
